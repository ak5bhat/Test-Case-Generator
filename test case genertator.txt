Perf test case
Generate a test case on Performance test case for Website Response Time. Before Expected results, place '$$$' as shown

Test Case Name: Website Response Time Performance Test

Test Objective: To measure the website's response time under different user loads.

Test Scenario:
1. Simulate 100 users accessing the website simultaneously.
2. Measure the average response time for each user request.
3. Verify that the website response time meets the specified performance requirement (e.g., response time < 3 seconds).

Test Setup:
- Use a performance testing tool such as JMeter or Gatling to simulate user load and measure response times.
- Ensure that the test environment is representative of the production environment to obtain accurate results.

Test Steps:
1. Set up the performance testing tool to simulate 100 virtual users.
2. Configure the tool to distribute the user load evenly across the website pages.
3. Start the performance test and monitor the response times for each user request.
4. Continue the test for a defined duration to collect sufficient data.
$$$
Expected Results:
- The average response time for all user requests is within the specified performance requirement (e.g., response time < 3 seconds).
- The website handles the user load without critical performance degradation or errors.

Pass Criteria:
- The average response time is within the specified performance requirement.
- The website performs efficiently and meets the performance expectations under the given user load.

Performance Metrics:
- Average Response Time: Measure the average time taken for each user request to receive a response from the website.
- Throughput: Measure the number of requests processed per second or minute by the website.
- Error Rate: Measure the percentage of failed requests or HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500) during the test.

Performance Analysis:
- Analyze the collected performance data to identify any performance bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
- Check for slow-performing pages, database queries, or external dependencies that may affect the overall response time.
- Evaluate the impact of the user load on website performance and resource utilization.

Notes:
- Repeat the test with different user loads (e.g., 50, 200 users) to assess the website's scalability.
- Performance testing should be performed on a staging or test environment to avoid affecting the live production system.
- Keep the test duration long enough to collect a sufficient amount of data for reliable analysis.
- If the test fails to meet the performance requirements, investigate and optimize the identified performance bottlenecks.

The goal of this performance test case is to ensure that the website can handle the specified user load while maintaining acceptable response times. It helps identify potential performance issues and enables you to optimize the website for better user experience and scalability.
